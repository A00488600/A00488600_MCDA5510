Hello,

I'm Vishnu Teja from India, with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I chose this program because of its small class size and its strong track record of producing successful graduates. I’m excited to be part of this academic community.

You can reach me via email at Sai.Vishnu.Teja.Reddy.Pulim@smu.ca, and my A# is A00488600.

My areas of interest include Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Business Intelligence.

A fun fact about me: I have a strong understanding of high school-level physics and a decent knowledge of quantum physics. In fact, I originally aspired to become a physics research scientist after high school, but I couldn’t get into the university I had dreamed of. With no particular interest in other fields, my father, a mechanical engineer, encouraged me to pursue engineering. Given my strong academic performance in school, I chose Computer Science, which allowed me to select the branch and university of my choice.
Another interesting fact: I am fluent in five Indian languages—English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, and Tamil—and can read, write, and speak in all of them.
